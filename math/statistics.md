## Mean, Variance and Standard Deviation

**Mean** is the _average_ of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers in the set and dividing by the number of elements in the set. It is denoted by the symbol $\mu$.

$$
\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i
$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the mean
- $m$ is the number of elements in the set
- $x_i$ are the individual elements in the set

**Variance** is a measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each number and the mean. It is denoted by the symbol $\sigma^2$.

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \mu)^2
$$

where:
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance
- $m$ is the number of elements in the set
- $x_i$ are the individual elements in the set


**Standard Deviation** is the square root of the variance. It is denoted by the symbol $\sigma$.

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
$$

> The standard variation is the measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are in the unit of the data set. Whereas the variance is the measure of how spread out the numbers in square units of the data set.
