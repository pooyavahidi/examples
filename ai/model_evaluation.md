# Model Evaluation
Model evaluation involves the methods and metrics (e.g., cross-validation, test accuracy, precision-recall) used to assess the [generalization](generalization.md) performance and ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting.

Model evaluation provides the tools to measure generalization. For instance, evaluating performance on a validation or test set helps estimate how well the model generalizes. It serves as the practical mechanism to verify generalization.

## Cross Validation
TBD
